# AkitaTodo

This is a simple demonstration of using [Akita](https://datorama.github.io/akita/) with Angular that I created to experiment with Akita and its EntityStore. It is designed to be a simple "todo" application that demonstrates adding new entities to an EntityStore. This simple app does not include Todo editing, but my other Akita repo, [Akita-Active](https://github.com/TimTCrouch/akita-active), demonstrates tracking an active entity and updating it. I make no claim that everything is perfect in this as I am just learning Akita, but it does work.
